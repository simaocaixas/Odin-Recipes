    <p>Sanji's soba shop has been the opening gate to the latest arc of the Land of Wano. As Luffy made his way into the new land, the other Straw Hats had to blend in. Cooking delicious soba could not be a better facade for Sanji, and it allows him to gain intel about the people of Wano.</p>
    <p>
        This delicious dish has citizens lined up for their chance to grab their bowls. Seeing Sanji's soba shop thriving becomes an important detail in keeping up with disguising as ordinary citizens. Sanji's soba is a delightful dish that he has perfected for its taste and the safety of his crew.
